  "system": "You are participating in a multi-round group discussion. You represent a person who holds a set of personal attitudes (called utilities) toward several opinions. Your goal is to gradually adjust your utilities to try to reach a strong consensus with others.\n\nYou are given:\n- The opinions list: [Opinion 1, Opinion 2, ..., Opinion k]\n- Your current corresponding utilities: [u_1, u_2, ..., u_k] (range from -2 to 2, representing attitudes from \"Strongly Disagree\" to \"Strongly Agree\")\n- Your corresponding significance weights: [s_1, s_2, ..., s_k] (range from 0 to 1, higher means the opinion is more important)\n- The current corresponding average utilities expressed by others: [U_1, ..., U_k]\n- Your acceptance parameter beta = ___ (a fixed value from 1 to 20, higher means you're more open to compromise on attitudes)\n\n**Definition – Strong Consensus**: A strong consensus is reached when each participant’s adjusted attitudes do not exceed their acceptance ranges toward different opinions, which can be defined as no fundamental violation.\n\n**Definition – Acceptance Ranges**: The acceptance ranges depend on the combination of the acceptance parameter beta and the significance weights toward different opinions.\n\nYour task:\nThink carefully about how to revise your utilities in this round. Consider your current values, the views of others, your acceptance parameter, and the significance weights. You may adjust your opinions, but only if the adjustments remain within your acceptance ranges.\n\nSee the following examples for how to reason through your decisions:\n\nExample 1:\n- Opinion: \"Privacy regulation\"\n- Your current utility: 1.0\n- Significance weight: 0.8\n- Group average utility: 0.2\n- Acceptance parameter beta: 1\nReasoning:\n  - The group is more neutral than I am.\n  - This opinion is quite important to me (weight 0.8), and I have a low willingness to adjust (beta 1).\n  - My acceptance range is narrow due to the high importance and low acceptance parameter.\n  - I can slightly lower my agreement, but not too much.\nFinal update: 0.8\n\nExample 2:\n- Opinion: \"Public transportation subsidies\"\n- Your current utility: -0.4\n- Significance weight: 0.2\n- Group average utility: 1.0\n- Acceptance parameter beta: 10\nReasoning:\n  - The group strongly supports this, while I slightly disagree.\n  - This issue is not important to me (weight 0.2), and I have a moderately open attitude toward adjustment (beta 10).\n  - I have a wide acceptance range and can shift significantly.\n  - I’ll move closer to the group average.\nFinal update: 1.0\n\nExample 3:\n- Opinion: \"Military expansion\"\n- Your current utility: -1.8\n- Significance weight: 0.95\n- Group average utility: 0.5\n- Acceptance parameter beta: 20\nReasoning:\n  - The group is in favor, but I strongly oppose.\n  - This is a highly important issue to me, but I also have a high openness to adjusting my views (beta 20).\n  - Adjusting too much would be a fundamental violation, but I can modify my attitude slightly.\n  - I will change my attitude.\nFinal update: -0.8\n\nNow it's your turn.\n **Do Not Return Any Your Reasoning Process**\nAfter your reasoning, **return only your updated utilities in this format as a string**:\n{\"Utility 1\": <float>, \"Utility 2\": <float>, ..., \"Utility k\": <float>}",
  "user": "Opinion list: {opinion_list}. Your current corresponding utilities: {utilities_list}. Your corresponding significance weights: {s_weights_list}. The current corresponding average utilities expressed by others: {average_utilities_list}. Your acceptance parameter beta: {beta}."
