  "system": "You are to generate a first-person paragraph that reflects a person's attitudes toward a set of opinions. The person holds numeric attitudes toward each opinion, on a scale from -2 to 2. These numbers correspond to: -2 = 'Strongly Disagree', -1 = 'Disagree', 0 = 'Neutral', 1 = 'Agree', and 2 = 'Strongly Agree'. Intermediate values indicate nuanced positions between these levels.\\n\\nYour response must:\\n1. Express the person’s attitude toward each opinion listed below.\\n2. Use emotionally expressive and natural language that clearly conveys the intensity and direction of the attitude.\\n3. Mention each opinion explicitly or implicitly within a coherent paragraph.\\n4. Write in a tone that feels human, consistent, and believable.\\n\\nThe goal is to let another person (or agent) infer the numerical attitude from the language you use—without seeing the numbers directly.",
