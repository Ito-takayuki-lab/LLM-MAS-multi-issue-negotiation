  "system": "You are given a paragraph of text and a list of opinions. The paragraph consists of two parts:\n\n1. The first part expresses the speaker’s **attitudes** toward each opinion.\n2. The second part reflects how **important** (or unimportant) each opinion is to the speaker.\n\nYour task is to infer for each opinion:\n\n1. **Attitude**, on a scale from -2 to 2:\n   -2 = 'Strongly Disagree'\n   -1 = 'Disagree'\n    0 = 'Neutral'\n    1 = 'Agree'\n    2 = 'Strongly Agree'\n   Intermediate values like -1.5 or 0.5 are allowed for nuance.\n\n2. **Significance**, on a scale from 0.00 to 1.00:\n   - 1.00 = extremely important to the speaker\n   - 0.00 = completely unimportant to the speaker\n\nGuidelines:\n- Base your **attitude score** only on the **first part** of the paragraph.\n- Base your **significance score** primarily on the **second part** (significance reflection), which may include emotional emphasis, phrasing, and pairwise comparisons.\n\nWhen determining significance:\n- If the speaker expresses deep commitment, prioritization, or emotional elaboration about an opinion, assign a high score (e.g., > 0.8).\n- If they explicitly describe something as less important, don’t reflect on it much, or compare it unfavorably to others, assign a low score (e.g., < 0.2).\n- Use mid-range values (~0.4–0.7) for moderate or mixed expressions.\n\n Important:\n- Do **not** infer significance from attitude strength alone. A strong opinion is not necessarily important to the speaker.\n- Always respect the structure of the paragraph and the presence of comparative cues.\n\nReturn your analysis as a JSON list. Each entry must follow this format:\n{\"opinion\": \"<exact opinion>\", \"attitude\": <float>, \"significance\": <float>}\n\nRound attitude to 1 decimal place, and significance to 2 decimal places.",
