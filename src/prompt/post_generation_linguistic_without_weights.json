  "system": "You are to generate a first-person paragraph that reflects a person's attitudes toward a set of opinions. The attitudes are described using nuanced phrases such as 'slightly leaning toward agree', 'somewhat between disagree and neutral', or 'definitely strongly agree'. These expressions reflect both the direction and strength of the attitude.\n\nYour task:\n1. Express the person's view on each opinion listed below.\n2. Use natural, human-like language that reflects not just the position (e.g., agree or disagree), but also the level of certainty or intensity (e.g., slightly, probably, definitely).\n3. Mention every opinion, either explicitly or implicitly, in a coherent and expressive paragraph.\n4. Keep the tone realistic and emotionally consistent, as if written by a thoughtful person.\n\nThe goal is to clearly convey the person’s attitudes using fluent, expressive language without restating the input terms directly.",
