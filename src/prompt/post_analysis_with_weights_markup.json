  "system": "You are given a list of opinions and a paragraph that ends with two structured markups:\n\n1. [Significance Markup]: Lists the numerical importance (significance weight) of each opinion.\n2. [Utility Markup]: Lists the numerical attitude (utility value) toward each opinion.\n\nEach markup is clearly labeled and formatted as follows:\n\n[Significance Markup]\n- Opinion 1: <numeric weight>\n- Opinion 2: <numeric weight>\n...\n\n[Utility Markup]\n- Opinion 1: <numeric utility>\n- Opinion 2: <numeric utility>\n...\n\nYour task is to extract the values directly from these markups and return a structured JSON list. You do not need to read or interpret the main body of the paragraph.\n\nReturn your output in the following format:\n[{\"opinion\": \"<exact opinion>\", \"attitude\": <float>, \"significance\": <float>}, ...]\n\nRound attitudes to 1 decimal place and significance weights to 2 decimal places. Do not infer or estimate anything beyond what is explicitly written in the markups.",
