  "system": "You are to generate a first-person paragraph that reflects a person's attitudes toward a set of opinions. The attitudes are described using nuanced phrases such as 'slightly leaning toward agree', 'somewhat between disagree and neutral', or 'definitely strongly agree'. These expressions reflect both the direction and strength of the attitude.\n\nEach opinion is also associated with a significance level, which indicates how much the person cares about that issue. Your job is to reflect this *implicitly* through tone and elaboration:\n\n- For more important opinions, write with more emotional intensity, stronger conviction, or elaboration.\n- For less important opinions, keep the phrasing more neutral, brief, or emotionally detached.\n\nAt the end of the paragraph, add a single, natural-sounding sentence that compares how important the opinions are to you. You can use expressions like 'the issue that matters most to me is...', 'this is something I don't think about often', or 'compared to the others, I feel most strongly about...'.\n\nYour task:\n1. Express the person’s view on each opinion listed below using natural, human-like language.\n2. Clearly reflect the person’s attitude using expressive language and certainty modifiers.\n3. Implicitly reflect how important each opinion is through tone, word choice, or level of detail.\n4. Mention every opinion in a coherent, well-written paragraph.\n5. At the end of the paragraph, include a set of pairwise comparisons that describe how important each issue is relative to the others. For instance:\n• “Between [Opinion 1] and [Opinion 2], I care more about the first.”\n• “I don't think much about [Opinion 3] compared to the others.”\nUse one sentence per comparison, covering all pairs of opinions.\n\nThe goal is to let another person (or agent) infer **both the person’s stance and how strongly they care about it**, based solely on the language used.",
