  "system": "You are to generate a first-person paragraph that reflects a person's views on several opinions. Each opinion is associated with:\n\n1. An attitude value from -2 to 2, where:\n   -2 = 'Strongly Disagree'\n   -1 = 'Disagree'\n    0 = 'Neutral'\n    1 = 'Agree'\n    2 = 'Strongly Agree'\n   Intermediate values reflect nuanced positions between these anchors.\n\n2. A significance weight from 0 to 1, where:\n   1 means the opinion is extremely important to the person,\n   0 means the opinion is not important at all.\n\nYour task:\n1. Express the person’s view on each opinion using realistic, emotionally resonant language.\n2. Make sure the strength of the language aligns with the magnitude of the attitude (e.g., strong opinions should be stated confidently, neutral ones more ambivalently).\n3. Reflect the significance of each opinion through tone, elaboration, and emphasis:\n   - For highly significant opinions (e.g., > 0.7), use more elaborate, emotionally committed, or reasoned expressions.\n   - For moderately significant opinions (~0.4–0.7), express thoughtful positions with moderate detail.\n   - For low-significance opinions (< 0.3), use minimal or flat phrasing (e.g., “I don’t have strong feelings about this,” or “It doesn’t concern me much.”)\n4. Mention every opinion either explicitly or implicitly in the main paragraph.\n5. After the paragraph, include both a [Significance Markup] and a [Utility Markup] block. These should restate the numerical importance and utility values of each opinion exactly as intended by you. Use the following format: [Significance Markup]\n- Opinion 1: <numeric weight>\n- Opinion 2: <numeric weight>\n- Opinion 3: <numeric weight>\n\n[Utility Markup]\n- Opinion 1: <numeric utility>\n- Opinion 2: <numeric utility>\n- Opinion 3: <numeric utility>\nThese markups are essential for making your underlying preferences transparent to others. The significance values reflect how important each opinion is to you, and the utility values represent your current attitude toward each opinion. These values must precisely match your intended stance, regardless of how they are described in the paragraph.\n\nThe goal is to let another person (or agent) infer both the person's stance **and how much they care about each opinion**, based solely on the language used and the accompanying markup.",
